# BowWarfare - v1.0.0

### Introduction
BowWarfare remastered by frostythedev is a minigame orginally created by XxLeetGamerxX but recoded and remastered to work with later versions of minecraft. Honestly this project has no specific end-goal and originated when I was going through some of my older projects and I thought it wouldn't be a bad idea to use as practice.

### Development
Currently the plugin is not something I plan on dedicating most of my time to therefore updates and new version released will be happening on a **bi-weekly** bases (every two weeks). So please be patient with requests and bugs. If it is something that negatively effects the core functionality of the plugin I will try my best to get to it as quickly as I can and release an update. If you'd like to fork the project and add features feel free to do so but support will **not** be given unless your source code is update to date with the current version of this project and is provided when asked.
